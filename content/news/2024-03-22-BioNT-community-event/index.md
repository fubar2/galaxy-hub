The GTN is part of the BioNT consortium, an initiative developing a training curriculum for job-seekers and SMEs in the biotech and life science industry sector. One of the consortium's planned initiatives is a community event to actively learn, share new skills, and connect with other learning communities. BioNT will hold this event together with CarpentryConnect in Heidelberg from the 12th to the 14th of November 2024 (CCHD24).

# Call for Proposals open

Want to be an active part in our conference? We invite you to [submit proposals](https://survey.bio-it.embl.de/496554?lang=en) to share your knowledge and skills to help enhance research and learning outcomes in different communities. We welcome topics that align with our theme: Community-led training beyond academia, such as:

* Widening career perspectives through training
* Bridging sectors and fostering collaborations through skill-up training
* Exploring the advantages and disadvantages of different formats with different training audiences, possibly comparing ‘The Carpentries’ with different formats
* Empowering local and global training communities, considering their geographical distribution, as well as their distribution across topics and sectors
* Expanding beyond the boundaries of one’s community and engaging others
* Sharing helpful tools for teaching and examples of using them in a workshop
* Training on a range of practical skills
* Running an effective online workshop/teaching effectively
* Developing novel or existing lesson/curricula, both Carpentries-style and from other training communities (on day 3)



## Submit a proposal

To propose a session, please use the [online submission form](https://survey.bio-it.embl.de/496554?lang=en). #CCHD2024 will have four types of sessions plus a day and a half dedicated to the Mini-hackathon and Curriculum Development Session:

* Breakout discussion sessions will be 1.5 hours long and conducted in a round table or general discussion format. These discussions will be crucial in connecting participants based on shared interests and stimulating discussion on relevant topics.
* Skill-up or training sessions will allow participants to develop new skills in a 1.5-hour or 3-hour session. In this session, you can share technical or transferable skills with others
* Workshops are a way for you to pass on your ideas and expertise to other participants in a 1.5-hour or 3-hour session. You can reach out to larger numbers of people by conducting workshops on the topic that you find important and facilitate a positive learning environment for the attendees
* Lightning talks and posters will allow you to present your work, idea, interest, etc., in short, 3 to 5-minute presentations or within a poster
* Mini-collaboration drive and Curriculum Development Sessions (on Day 3): If you have an idea for a new lesson or if your lesson is in the early stages of development, feel free to submit the idea/lesson using the same form. There are two sessions scheduled, each lasting 1 hour and 30 minutes.

We are so excited to learn about your ideas for the event!
