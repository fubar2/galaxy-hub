Back in September 2005 a paper was published in Genome Research, which got increasingly cited - 1,046 times to date. Its title: "[Galaxy: a platform for interactive large-scale genome analysis](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.4086505)"

There were multiple follow-up papers which got even more cited, due to Galaxy's great success throughout the computational biology field and beyond. However, acknowledging the 2005 paper as the birth of the global Galaxy community, in September 2023 we are considerably right to celebrate Galaxy's 18th birthday.

Congratulations to all the inventors, contributors, supporters, fans - keep the spirit and enjoy the next 18 years!
