The [Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de) and the [Galaxy Team](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/people) are happy to announce the ongoing implementation of EuroScienceGateway project, financed by the European Commission though the European Research Executive Agencyâ€˜s HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01 funding line, under grant agreement number 101057388.

EuroScienceGateway aims to deliver a robust, scalable, seamlessly integrated open infrastructure for data-driven research, contributing an innovative and customizable service for EOSC that enables operational open and FAIR data and data processing, empowering European researchers to embrace the new digital age of science. The overall objective of the EuroScienceGateway is to achieve our shared vision of an open collaborative digital space for European scientists.

The project is implemented between the 1st of September 2022 and the 31st of August 2025 by a consortium of 14 EU partners and 3 associated partners coming from 13 different European countries (Germany, Netherlands, Italy, France, Belgium, Spain, Norway, Czech Republic, Turkey, Slovakia, Poland, UK and Switzerland).  The project has been officially launched during the European Galaxy Days, in a kick-off meeting organized between the 6th and 7th of October in Freiburg, Germany.
