The overall objective of the [AquaINFRA project](https://aquainfra.eu/about) is to develop a virtual environment equipped with FAIR multi-disciplinary data and services to support marine and freshwater scientists and stakeholders restoring healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters. The AquaINFRA virtual environment - [Aqua's Galaxy](https://aqua.usegalaxy.eu/) -  will enable the target stakeholders to store, share, access, analyse and process research data and other research digital objects from their own discipline, across research infrastructures, disciplines and national borders leveraging on EOSC and the other existing operational dataspaces (e.g., EMODnet, Copernicus Marine Service, Digital Twins, etc.).

Markus Konkol ([52North](https://52north.org/), MÃ¼nster) and Merret Buurman ([Institute for Freshwater Ecology](https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/institutes/leibniz-institutes-all-lists/leibniz-institute-of-freshwater-ecology-and-inland-fisheries)), Berlin) will be representing AquaINFRA as an on-boarding community in ESG WP5. They are developing the processing platform, based on Galaxy and Pygeoapi (a Python platform to run OGC-standard compliant processing services accessible via REST API). AquaINFRA will process data from diverse sources like pollutant dispersion from rivers to coastal waters in Catalunya, satellite-imagery analysis for the North Sea and the Elbe, nutrients in Baltic Sea, small river in-situ analysis in Finland, etc. They are looking for HPC resources to run dispersion modeling tasks.
