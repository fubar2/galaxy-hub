The [EuroScienceGateway (ESG)](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) team, working in the UK to develop Galaxy tools for materials science, gave one of the latest webinars of the [Physical Sciences Data Infrastructure (PSDI) project](https://www.psdi.ac.uk). The webinar was about the use of the Galaxy platform in the post-processing of experimental and simulation data associated with large scale experiments performed at national facilities, such as the [Science and Technology Facilities Council in the UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/).  

This post-processing requires that different software tools from various domains are connected into workflows, which can be quite complex. The webinar presented the web-based, open-source, Galaxy tools developed as part of the ESG, and showed how they can be used to manage the software tools and data associated to muon and x-ray experiments.
