#### MBP2024 - Molecular Biology of Plants 2024

The Conference [Molecular Biology of Plants (MBP)](https://www.pflanzen-molekularbiologie.de/conference-molecular-biology-of-plants) of the Section Plant Physiology and Molecular Biology of the DBG will take place at Hennef, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, from 4th to 7th March 2024. It will be organized by Prof. Dr. Christopher Grefen (Bochum), Prof. Dr. Ute HÃ¶cker (Cologne), and Prof. Dr. Andreas Meyer (Bonn). If interested, please visit [full program page](https://www.pflanzen-molekularbiologie.de/fileadmin/user_upload/SPPMB_Program/2024/MBP2024_program_v4_2_online.pdf).


**Deepti Varshney** and **Saskia Hiltemann** will jointly present a Poster entitled **"MAdLand Resources & Tools"**.

[MAdLand](https://madland.science/) is a DFG-funded research consortium exploring the molecular mechanism behind the transition from water to land, from alga to land plant. All work presented in that poster is part of a collaboration between  **MAdLand, NFDI4Plants (DATAplant), Galaxy & de.NBI**. The poster presents MAdLand's cutting-edge resources useful for plant research: **MAdLand DB (GenomeZoo), TAPscan v4, and DataPLANT ARCs**. Below is an abstract for the Poster Presentation.

MAdLandDB represents a comprehensive protein database accessible through the [Galaxy web-based platform](https://usegalaxy.eu). With a particular focus on non-seed plants and streptophyte algae, it delivers non-redundant, reliable genome sequences utilizing BLAST and Diamond search functionalities for comparative and evolutionary questions in plant biology. The database includes reference/outgroup genomes of various lineages, including, e.g., fungi, animals, phylo-diverse algae, bacteria, and archaea. It is actively developed and maintained in the [MAdLand](https://madland.science/) context. The intuitive Galaxy interface ensures effortless data access and retrieval and remains consistently updated with the latest genomic insights.

[TAPscan v4](https://tapscan.plantcode.cup.uni-freiburg.de) is an advanced tool for genome-wide annotation of plant transcription-associated proteins (TAPs). TAPs (TFs and TRs) are key to understanding the development and evolution of plant form and function. Access to reliable, up-to-date classifications of TAPs enables comparative analyses that expand our knowledge of plant transcriptional regulation. Moreover, TAPscan is currently being integrated into the Galaxy framework, so users may employ it for their own datasets.

Finally, MAdLand is committed to contributing to the [DataPLANT](https://www.nfdi4plants.de) Research Data Management (RDM) platform, which supports the creation of ARCs (Annotated Research Contexts) to encapsulate all research data (raw and metadata) in a FAIR, open and standardized manner. ARCs are an [RO-crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) implementation and provide an easy-to-use way to re-analyze data generated by other labs, e.g. in Galaxy. Conversely, analyses performed in Galaxy can also be exported directly as RO-crates.
