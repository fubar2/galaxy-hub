# Special Interest Group Spotlight: Single Cell

The Galaxy Single Cell Community has had a stellar year, advancing tools and workflows while fostering global collaboration. Expanding beyond scRNA-seq, the community now offers tools for single-cell ATAC-seq and CITE-Seq analysis. Updates include a revamped UI for RNA STARSolo, new tools for scATAC-seq data preprocessing, and enhanced functionalities for Seurat. Community building efforts have led to the unification of single-cell subdomains and the launch of the Single Cell Community of Practice hub. Collaboration has also extended internationally, with projects spanning three continents. Training initiatives have been revamped, including the introduction of the Case Study Reloaded tutorial for parallel trajectory analysis. The community remains committed to efficiency, consolidating instances and preventing duplication to streamline workflows.

Join the community for another exciting year with the Galaxy Single Cell Community as they continue to push boundaries and explore the cosmos of single-cell analysis! __For more information on the Single Cell Special Interest Group, please contact [Wendi Bacon](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/nomadscientist/)__.


# Galaxy Success Stories

__Scalable, accessible and reproducible reference genome assembly and evaluation in Galaxy (Larivière et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2024)__

The Earth BioGenome Project aims to sequence genomes of all ~1.8 million eukaryotic species over the next decade, requiring a significant increase in genome production pace. To achieve this, researchers combined the expertise of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) and the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) to develop an automated assembly pipeline within the Galaxy ecosystem. This pipeline uses PacBio HiFi reads and long-distance information from Hi-C maps and/or optical maps to generate nearly complete assemblies, with extensive quality control functions. Validation using vertebrate datasets has shown improvements in haplotype resolution, particularly for large, repeat-rich genomes. Future work will focus on improving efficiency, incorporating ultra-long-read data, and automating the curation process. The workflows and instructions are [available on the Galaxy website](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/vgp/workflows/), and new genome assemblies are being submitted to the [NCBI under the Vertebrate Genome Project BioProject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/489243).

__Anthropogenic contamination sources drive differences in antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli in three urban lakes (Wight et al., Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 2024)__

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing concern, even in environmental reservoirs, highlighting the need for thorough monitoring. A study isolated antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli from urban waterbodies over 15 months, examining their susceptibilities, population structures, and genetic resistance determinants. Despite close proximity, E. coli populations in each site showed distinct antimicrobial resistance patterns, with many belonging to globally concerning sequence types. Widespread resistance was observed to key antimicrobials like amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin, but susceptibility to last-line drugs was maintained. Acquired resistance genes and chromosomal mutations were identified as key mechanisms. Whole-genome analysis revealed a diverse population with various resistance and virulence genes, including those on the chromosome (e.g., blaCTX-M). Environmental persistence, likely facilitated by wild birds, and transfer of genetic elements were identified as significant contributors to resistance patterns. The researchers used the European Galaxy server (usegalaxy.eu) for bioinformatic analyses, including extracting and aligning single nucleotide polymorphisms from core genes.

__Genomic variation in pepper vein yellows viruses in Australia, including a new putative variant, PeVYV-10 (Filardo et al., Archives of Virology, 2024)__

Following its initial identification in Australia in 2016, pepper vein yellows virus (PeVYV) has been sporadically found in various hosts and locations. Genomic comparisons of 14 PeVYV-like isolates suggested the presence of potential new variants. High-throughput sequencing of six PeVYV-positive plants revealed eight PeVYV-like sequences, including isolates closely related to known PeVYV variants and others showing significant genetic divergence, tentatively named PeVYV-10. This study also marks the first report of a PeVYV-like virus infecting garlic. The researchers utilized Galaxy Australia for quality trimming, adaptor and primer sequence removal, and de novo assembly of paired reads, followed by further analysis of contigs and BLAST results in Geneious 10.

# Galaxy is Leaving Twitter

__Galaxy will be leaving Twitter/X effective March 31st, 2024.__ We believe this decision is necessary as the platform no longer supports our commitment to fostering constructive scientific discourse. Recent changes have made it challenging to maintain the level of discussion we strive for.

We value the support and engagement from our community on Twitter/X and assure you this decision was made after careful consideration. Although we bid farewell to Twitter/X, you can still stay connected with us through our other communication channels, such as [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/galaxyproject.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://mstdn.science/@galaxyproject), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/galaxy-project). We will continue to cross-post all social media contributions there. Additionally, you can stay updated by visiting the [Galaxy Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/), and we encourage you to stay connected with the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/), which is active on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/galaxytraining.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://mstdn.science/@gtn).

Thank you for your ongoing support. We look forward to continuing our journey with you and maintaining the strong sense of community that defines Galaxy.

## Advances in Genome Biology and Technology

In February, Galaxy had a major presence at AGBT in Orlando Florida. This included being featured during a keynote presentation by Michael Schatz on [BioDIGS: BioDiversity and Informatics for Genomics Scholars](https://biodigs.org/). This is an exciting new initiative to perform a distributed soil metagenomics project throughout the United States working hand-in-hand with dozens of institutions especially community colleges, historically Black colleges and Universities, tribal colleges and universities, and Hispanic-serving institutions. Galaxy was featured as a supporting platform for the project, especially to empower students and researchers who had limited prior experience or who lacked large scale computing infrastructure for the research. Stay tuned for more updates on this project later this year!
