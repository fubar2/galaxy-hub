Welcome to the world of MAdLandDB – your go-to protein database for a comprehensive collection of fully sequenced plant and algal genomes. Developed and actively maintained by the [Rensing lab](https://plantco.de/), MAdLandDB stands out for its emphasis on non-seed plants and streptophyte algae. In this blog post, we'll explore the key features and recent updates of this resource.

### Introduction

<div class="col-sm-9",tyle="width: 80%">


MAdLandDB is a protein database comprising a comprehensive collection of fully sequenced plant and algal genomes, with a particular emphasis on non-seed plants and streptophyte algae. This database contains over 21 million sequences, representing a diverse group of more than 600 species. Its scope extends to various organisms, including fungi, animals, the SAR group, bacteria, and archaea, fostering a platform for comprehensive comparative analysis. The database's species abbreviation system, using a 5-letter code, simplifies species identification. For instance, CHABR – <i>Chara braunii</i>, is an example of how this nomenclature works. It contains non-redundant, reliable protein sequences utilizing [BLASTp](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/ncbi_blast_plus/ncbi_blastp_wrapper/2.14.1+galaxy1) and [Diamond](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/diamond/bg_diamond/2.0.15+galaxy0) search functionalities on the [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/) interface for comparative and evolutionary questions in plant biology.

### What Sets MAdLandDB Apart? 


**Non-redundancy:** One of the database's primary strengths lies in its non-redundant nature. Sequence data is carefully curated, ensuring that you access only the most reliable genomic information.


**Genome Project Origins:** MAdLandDB takes pride in sourcing its sequences predominantly from genome projects. This approach enhances the reliability of the data and provides a solid foundation for various comparative analyses.

**Comprehensive Information:** The 5-letter code in the sequence header along with the gene ID allows for essential, short information and also features the source of gene encoding (plastome or transcriptome-based, etc.). The source/metadata for all genomes is available via the published papers.
