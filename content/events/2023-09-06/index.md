EuroScienceGateway and Galaxy [were presented on Swiss SKA Days 2023](
https://indico.skatelescope.org/event/1031/contributions/9848/) in Zurich, 
an event which welcomed almost 150 astronomers from all over the world.

The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) project is an international effort 
to build the world’s largest radio telescope, with eventually over one square kilometer 
of collecting area in South Africa and Australia. 

One of the big challenges of SKA is storing and effectively exploiting Exobyte-scale data archive.
This archive will be difficult to transport, highlighting the role of web-based data analysis platforms which bring the scientific workflows to the data.
Galaxy and EuroScienceGateway were presented to show possible ways to develop collaborative web-based data analysis.
