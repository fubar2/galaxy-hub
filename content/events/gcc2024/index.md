The [Galaxy Community Conference (GCC)](/gcc) is an annual conference focused on
the use and development of the [Galaxy platform](https://galaxyproject.org/) for
data-intensive biomedical research. **The conference brings together scientists,
software developers, and trainers of Galaxy from a variety of disciplines to share their
experiences, knowledge, and skills.**

The conference included talks, posters, and workshops on a wide range of topics
related to Galaxy, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and more.
The GCC provides an opportunity for attendees to learn about the latest
developments in the Galaxy platform and to connect with other members of the
Galaxy community.
