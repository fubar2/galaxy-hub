## GCC2024 CollaborationFest (CoFest!)

CoFest is a community gathering by those interested in
contributing to Galaxy's tool set, documentation, training materials, code base,
and anywhere else that expands the Galaxy ecosystem.

CoFest participants will gather around shared interests and address common
topics related to those interests. It is an informal, highly interactive meeting
where you get to "hack" on a topic of choice - and you can do it with others
that share similar interests.


## Goals!

<p class="lead">
    <strong>
        The goals of CoFest are to expand the Galaxy contributor community and its ecosystem.
    </strong>
</p>

That's a short sentence, but it is very deliberately worded:

* Our **first goal is to expand the contributor community**.  This CoFest is
  first and foremost about welcoming new contributors and helping you learn the
  resources and meet the people that will help you contribute.
* The **second goal is to expand the Galaxy Ecosystem**. Not just the code, but
  the whole ecosystem. That includes training, tools, best practice workflows,
  documentation, test cases, translations, infrastructure, and yes, even code.

This is a Collaboration Fest. Not a hackathon, not a codefest, but a *CollaborationFest*.

Welcome aboard! If you'd like to get involved check out our live
