### By car

[Brno](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rx4QGKYY42DVauLq8) is located on the main Czech
highway D1 and D2. For highways and some bigger roads it is necessary to have a
[highway sticker](https://edalnice.cz/en/index.html), which is available for
purchase
[online](https://edalnice.cz/en/single-purchase/index.html#/eshop/order) or at
the border crossing, petrol stations, or post offices.

Please verify whether your hotel or accommodation also provides parking, as
there is no free parking around the center and parking spots on the streets are
very limited. If you plan to bring your car, please read the [parking related
information](https://www.parkovanivbrne.cz/en) provided by the city of Brno. The
closest paid and guarded parking within the proximity of the center is at
[Janačkovo divadlo](https://www.jdparking.cz/en/) and about 5 minutes walking
distance.

cost of about 130 EUR from either Prague or Vienna. The transport can be booked
directly on the [company
website](https://www.brno-transport.cz/en/passenger-transport-order).


If you will be arriving to Brno without a working cell service, it is a good
idea to save an offline map of the city on your phone before the trip to ease
navigation.

# GCC2024 venue

GCC2024 will be held at the [Hotel
International](https://www.hotelinternational.cz/en/), located at [Husova 16,
602 00 Brno-střed](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SPxpRFZs6APq5TfG7).
[See the venue!](https://www.hotelinternational.cz/en/rs/visualization-virtual-tour/)

The hotel is located right at the edge of the historic center between the main
square and the castle. Enjoy an evening walk up to the castle to enjoy the view
or go explore the buzzling city center and grab a drink in one of the charming
pubs or caffees.

# Czech currency

The Czech Republic has its own currency, the [Czech crown
(CZK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_koruna), with the [exchange rate of
1EUR to about
25CZK](https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/en/?from=EUR&to=CZK&amount=1).
Many places accept payments by card and there are many cash exchange points in
the city center that offer exchanges of most currencies at good rates.

## Getting around Brno

Brno has excellent public transport and all trips can be paid by credit card on
the vehicle. Otherwise, tickets can be bought in cash at the driver, though this
is not recommended. For longer trips, Czech Railways has an excellent
[app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/M%C5%AFj_vlak?id=cz.cd.mujvlak.an&pli=1)
in english to buy train tickets.

As the conference venue is located right in the city center, we recommend
exploring the city by foot, as the center is almost exclusively for pedestrians
and vehicles are only allowed with a special permit. In case you would like to
explore other areas, simply hop on a tram or bus, beep in and enjoy the ride!

If you want to explore the city on your own and off the beaten track, simply
rent a [nextbike](https://www.nextbikeczech.com/en/mesto/brno-en/) and take a
trip along the river on one of Brno's central bike lanes.

# Activities beside the conference

The [BRNOPAS tourist card](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/brnopas/) can be your
guide around Brno, highlighting interesting places and offering discounts or
free admission to the 5 popular places: gardens at Brno villas, Old Town Hall
tower, Brno underground, Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, and the Brno Zoo.
The card is also offers free ticket on city transportation.

[Vila Tugendhat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Tugendhat) was built in
1929–1930 for Greta and Fritz Tugendhat to a design by the German architect
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Its history is at least as fascinating as its cultural
significance. It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2001.

![Villa Tugendhat](/images/events/gcc2024/tugendhat.jpg)

For the active, we recommend trying the [Hangar](https://hangarbrno.cz/en/home/)
bouldering gym by [Adam Ondra](https://www.adamondra.com/bio/) or going for a
run around the [Lužánky](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/place/park-luzanky/) park.
If you have more time on your hands, enjoy the [Moravian
Karst](https://www.moravskykras.net/en/moravian-karst.html) on a hike or explore
some of its caves. The best place to start your trip is Blansko, which can be
reached by train in 20 minutes from the Brno main train station (Brno hlavní
nádraží).

For everyone interested in arts and culture, Brno has several [museums and
galleries](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/explore-brno/go-to-brnos-museums-and-galleries/)
showcasing various aspects of Czech culture and history.

In 2017, Brno was awarded the prestigious title of UNESCO Creative City of
Music, thus joining a network of 46 cities viewing music as one of their
development priorities. Brno's [music scene](http://www.musicfriendlycity.cz/)
has plenty to offer!
