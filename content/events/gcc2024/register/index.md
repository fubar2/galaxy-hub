## Meeting: June 24-27

The general meeting portion of GCC2024 consist of a series of peer-reviewed
talks, posters, demos, training sessions, Birds-of-a-Feather meetups, and sponsor talks.

The registration fee includes admission to the meeting events, snacks and drinks
during the morning/afternoon break, and lunch for each day.

Tuesday evening will be the official conference dinner, which needs to be
purchased along with the registration. If you'd like to purchase additional
dinner tickets for your travel companion(s) you can do so at the time of
registration.

**Please note that all prices are listed in Euros (EUR) and exclude the mandatory
VAT (21%).** When paying for the registration, you can use a credit card or do a bank
transfer. You can also register and request the payment be processed afterwards
by someone else, such as your department administrator. If you prefer to
reason in a different currency, here is a convenient [currency
converter](https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/en/?from=EUR&to=USD&amount=360)
to see how these numbers compare.

Note that online registration will close on June 15 but in-person registration
will be available onsite during the event.

**If you are currently working in a low-income country**, as defined by the
World Bank, please email the [organizers](mailto:gcc2024-org@gaggle.email) before
registering and ask for a 50% discount code that you can apply during
registration. The [list of eligible low-income countries is available in this
document](https://gxy-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/low-income-countries.pdf).

**If you are a GTN trainer or a member of the scientific committee at GCC2024**
and are in need of financial help, please email the [event
organizers](mailto:gcc2024-org@gaggle.email) and a discount code will be
provided.
