# GCC2024 abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of GCCs. These include
oral, poster, and demo presentations. All the abstracts for presentations are
are submitted by the community and go through a peer review process by the
[scientific committee](/events/gcc2024/organizers/#scientific-committee-members)
before being accepted into the conference program. Once the conference program
has been finalized, an electronic version of the abstract book will be made
available.

GCC2024 is a Galaxy-centric conference but the topics presented can vary
greatly. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:
* Methods and pipelines for analysis of data that leverage Galaxy
* New or improved features within the Galaxy framework
* Outreach, training, and education in data science with Galaxy
* Tools and data integrated with Galaxy

**For GCC2024, all presentations must be in-person** so if you cannot attend the
conference in Brno, please do not submit an abstract. By submitting an abstract,
you agree that at least one of the authors will register and present the work.


# Call for Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions is open

Birds of a Feather, or BoF, sessions are informal gatherings during GCC that
allow participants to discus topics of interest. These are free-form events
that are organized by the participants and can take any form you'd like (eg,
presentations, brainstorming, architecture drawing, etc.).

**Interested in organizing a BoF? [Fill out this
form](https://forms.gle/bgbNpfc7YvLPz2ty7)** with some details so we can add it
to the schedule and help advertise. Also, keep an open mind and feel free to
propose fun activities as well, such as an evening run or a city tour.

# Option to publish in F1000 Galaxy gateway

Following GCC2024, you'll have an option to publish your slides or poster in the
[F1000 Galaxy gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy/). Besides
being a great collection of Galaxy-related content, each published artifact gets
a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), making it easier to reference in the future.


# Abstract submission guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then
presentations) that will resonate with GCC2024 participants.

* **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract
  submission is a [web
  form](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/7067/submitter) so no graphics or
  references are to be included.
* **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does your work use, describe, extend, deploy,
  benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem? If it does not, then it
  may not reviewed.
* **Compelling.** Is the work compelling? Will GCC2024 participants find your
  presentation interesting? Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting
  results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on.
* **Open Source / Open Access.** Not all presented work / resources must be open
  source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why
  it isn't. For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a
  firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and
  any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem. An abstract that
  merely highlights an inaccessible resource is not compelling.
* **You will need an Oxford Abstracts account.** We are using [Oxford
  Abstracts](https://oxfordabstracts.com/) portal for abstract submissions and
  they require a (free) account be created with them. Instructions on how to do
  so are [available on their
  website](https://help.oxfordabstracts.com/knowledge/creating-an-account-with-oxford-abstracts).

If you have any questions about the poster submission process, please reach out
to the [scientific committee
chair](/events/gcc2024/organizers/#scientific-program-chair).
