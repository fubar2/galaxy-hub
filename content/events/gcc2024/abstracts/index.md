# GCC2024 abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of GCCs. These include
oral, poster, and demo presentations. All the abstracts for presentations are
are submitted by the community and go through a peer review process by the
[scientific committee](/events/gcc2024/organizers/#scientific-committee-members)
before being accepted into the conference program. Once the conference program
has been finalized, an electronic version of the abstract book will be made
available.

GCC2024 is a Galaxy-centric conference but the topics presented can vary
greatly. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:
* Methods and pipelines for analysis of data that leverage Galaxy
* New or improved features within the Galaxy framework
* Outreach, training, and education in data science with Galaxy
* Tools and data integrated with Galaxy

If you are not sure if your topic fits, feel free to
[email the organizers](mailto:gcc2024-org@gaggle.email).

**For GCC2024, all presentations must be in-person** so if you cannot attend the
conference in Brno, please do not submit an abstract. By submitting an abstract,
you agree that at least one of the authors will register and present the work.


## Abstract submission guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then
presentations) that will resonate with GCC2024 participants.

* **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract
  submission is a [web
  form](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/7067/submitter) so no graphics or
  references are to be included.
* **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does your work use, describe, extend, deploy,
  benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem? If it does not, then it
  may not reviewed.
* **Compelling.** Is the work compelling? Will GCC2024 participants find your
  presentation interesting? Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting
  results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on.
* **Open Source / Open Access.** Not all presented work / resources must be open
  source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why
  it isn't. For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a
  firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and
  any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem. An abstract that
  merely highlights an inaccessible resource is not compelling.
* **You will need an Oxford Abstracts account.** We are using [Oxford
  Abstracts](https://oxfordabstracts.com/) portal for abstract submissions and
  they require a (free) account be created with them. Instructions on how to do
  so are [available on their
  website](https://help.oxfordabstracts.com/knowledge/creating-an-account-with-oxford-abstracts).

If you have any questions about the poster submission process, please reach out
to the [scientific committee
chair](/events/gcc2024/organizers/#scientific-program-chair).

# Logistical details for talks, posters, and demos


## Talk details

For GCC2024, **all talks will be 10 minutes long**. This includes time for
discussion with the audience so please plan your presentation accordingly. Every
accepted talk will automatically have an option to also present a poster.

Slides for your talk will be projected on a screen in the 16:9 format.

GCC2024 presentations will be streamed live. To support virtual attendees, the
organizers will need slides for all talks before the event (see [key
dates](/events/gcc2024/key-dates/)). **We ask that you please create your slides
in [Google Slides](https://slides.google.com), share the slide deck with *anyone
with the link* (in view-only mode), and provide a link in [this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-YnNkpP9jQ40SlFno-eemR33-KfjBn-W2vPkC5LhRCk/edit?usp=sharing)**
by the deadline listed above.


## Poster details

**Posters should fit within a 1.1m x 1.1m (44" x 44") space**. Supplies for
hanging posters are provided during the poster sessions. You must bring a
printed poster to the conference; there will be no opportunity to print at the
conference or for the organizers to print your poster.


## Demo details

Demo presentations give you an opportunity to showcase your software live for
the attendees. Demo sessions will be held alongside posters and you will be
provided with a table to place your laptop. There will be wifi connectivity
available but you need to bring your own laptop. Beyond that, it is entirely up
to you how you organize the demo.


# Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions

Birds of a Feather, or BoF, sessions are informal gatherings during GCC that
allow participants to discus topics of interest. These are free-form events
that are organized by the participants and can take any form you'd like (eg,
presentations, brainstorming, architecture drawing, etc.).

**Interested in organizing a BoF? [Fill out this
form](https://forms.gle/bgbNpfc7YvLPz2ty7)** with some details so we can add it
to the schedule and help advertise. Also, peep an open mind and feel free to
propose fun activities as well, such as an evening run or a city tour.


# Option to publish in F1000 Galaxy gateway

Following GCC2024, you'll have an option to publish your slides or poster in the
[F1000 Galaxy gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy/). Besides
being a great collection of Galaxy-related content, each published artifact gets
a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), making it easier to reference in the future.


# Questions?

Got questions about abstracts, abstract submission, or BoFs? Ask the [Scientific Program
Committee](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2023/organizers/#scientific-program-committee).
