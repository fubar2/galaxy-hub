# Machine Learning

</div>

This training offers a crash course in AI/ML. We discuss the history of AI, traditional classification/regression methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees, various Neural Network architectures such as feedforward, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks, and more advanced models such as Transformers that are used in Large Language Models (LLM). There are hands-on components to his training, where you implement various models using Galaxy's ML toolkit and interactive environments.
