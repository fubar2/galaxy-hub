# ChatGXY

</div>

The aim behind ChatGXY is to improve the user experience in Galaxy by translating tool bug reports into human-readable form, as well as provide users a convenient Galaxy help wizard (powered via OpenAI's API). ChatGXY's knowledge base is constructed using a LLM generated from sources such as Galaxy help, as well as the GTN and the hub.
