# Exposomics

</div>

The training shows how to use tools and workflows available on Galaxy for processing of mass spectrometry data to study the exposome.
Tools focus on high throughput and detection of low abundant analytes in high-resolution GC-MS and LC-MS data.

Participants will learn the conceptual steps of the underlying tools and how to choose parameters for their own data, also using additional open-source packages.
