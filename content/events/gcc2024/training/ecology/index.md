# Ecology

</div>

For the first GCC2024 Ecology oriented training session, we propose to give an overview of tools available through the european Galaxy Ecology instance. We will illustrate ecological data treatment, from data and metadata management to species distribution modeling through data exploration, visualisation and biodiversity indicators production dealing with genetics data as geographical information system or satellites remote-sensing ones.

For the second GCC2024 Ecology oriented training session, we propose to focus on the compute and analysis of biodiversity metrics.
