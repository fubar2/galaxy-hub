# Mass Spectrometry and Metaproteomics

</div>

Clinical metaproteomics has the potential to offer insights into the host-microbiome interactions underlying diseases. However, the field faces challenges in characterizing microbial proteins found in clinical samples, which are usually present at low abundance relative to the host proteins. As a solution, we have developed an integrated workflow coupling mass spectrometry-based analysis with customized bioinformatic identification, quantification and prioritization of microbial and host proteins, enabling targeted assay development to investigate host-microbe dynamics in disease. The bioinformatics tools are implemented in the Galaxy ecosystem, offering the development and dissemination of complex bioinformatic workflows. The modular workflow integrates MetaNovo (to generate a reduced protein database), SearchGUI/PeptideShaker and MaxQuant (to generate peptide-spectral matches (PSMs) and quantification), PepQuery2 (to verify the quality of PSMs), and Unipept and MSstatsTMT (for taxonomy and functional annotation). We have utilized this workflow in diverse clinical samples, from the characterization of nasopharyngeal swab samples to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness via analysis of residual fluid from cervical swabs. The complete workflow, including training data and documentation, is available via the Galaxy Training Network, empowering non-expert researchers to utilize these powerful tools in their clinical studies.
