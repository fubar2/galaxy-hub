# Quantum Processing in Galaxy

</div>

The era of quantum computing is here. As it continues to evolve from being a technology in its
infancy, to something that could perhaps revolutionize many aspects of daily life, it is capturing
the interest of academia, government, and industry alike. It is thus of great importance for
members of the scientific community to familiarize themselves with the theory and applications
of this new computing method, and most importantly, how to program and develop algorithms
on these devices. Here, we introduce the incorporation of Qiskit, IBM's python-based software
stack for quantum computing, into the Galaxy ecosystem. The basic theory of quantum
computing is revised in this training session, along with the many important components of the
coding framework and syntaxes. We introduce a series of previously developed Qiskit tutorials
and Jupyter notebooks, presenting new ways of solving some of the more relevant problems in
contemporary science and engineering. Attendees will get first-hand experience in building a
quantum circuit, simulating it classically, and ultimately executing it on quantum hardware
(provided they have set up a free account on IBM Quantum Lab at least two weeks
beforehand).
