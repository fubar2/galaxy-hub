The [Small Scale Galaxy Admins group](/community/sig/small-scale-admins/) is a [Galaxy community of practice](/community/sig/#communities-of-practice).
It has grown out of the "Small Scale Servers" subcommittee of the [Global Galaxy Steering Committee](/community/steering/).
The meetings are taking place every two months and are listed in the
[Galaxy WG calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=5l6o0msfduoir59hrab0jlkocc@group.calendar.google.com).
