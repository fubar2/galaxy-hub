The [Materials Galaxy](https://materials.usegalaxy.eu/) is a [Galaxy community of practice](https://galaxyproject.org/community/practice/). 
The meetings are taking place every month online. The focus is on Galaxy tools 
and workflows for material science use cases and on 
infrastructural and computational challenges associated with running these tools and workflows. Everyone interested is welcome to join us!
