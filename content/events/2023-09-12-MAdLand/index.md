## MAdLand - Molecular Adaptation to Land: plant evolution to change

At this meeting, the first year of the [MAdLand](https://madland.science/) DFG Priority Programme will be discussed and the projects of all participating labs will be presented (see also the [full program](https://4science.de/madland/Program.php)).

**Cristobal Gallardo Alba** and **Deepti Varshney** will present their talk entitled **Galaxy, Genome Zoo and NFDI4PLANTS: at your service** in which they emphasize the usefulness of the Galaxy platform in facilitating bioinformatics analysis for plant biologists.

In particular in plant biology, isoform analysis holds significant importance due to alternative splicing
that generates multiple isoforms from a single gene, significantly expanding the functional diversity of
the plant proteome. Accurate identification and quantification of isoforms are fundamental for unraveling
the complex regulatory networks governing plant development, stress responses, and specialized
metabolism. Galaxy offers a diverse array of specialized tools and workflows tailored specifically for
isoform analysis. These tools empower plant biologists to perform critical tasks such as transcript
assembly, isoform quantification, and the identification of differentially expressed isoforms.

As another example, they will introduce Genome Zoo, also known as MAdLandDB, a comprehensive protein
database accessible through the Galaxy platform. Focusing on non-seed plants and streptophyte algae,
it delivers non-redundant, reliable genome sequences through BLAST and Diamond searches. The user-
friendly Galaxy interface ensures effortless data access.

Finally, they will give a quick reminder to MAdLand members about leveraging the ARCs provided by
NFDI4PLANT to store large amounts of annotated research data, as a means to make data and metadata
available to and reusable by the community.
