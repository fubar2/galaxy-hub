# Objectives

The objective of this hackathon is to improve the annotation of the Galaxy resources (tools, training, workflows) for microbial data analysis by:

- Linking [microbial Galaxy tools](https://galaxyproject.github.io/galaxy_tool_metadata_extractor/microgalaxy/) to [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/) to obtain [EDAM ontology](https://edamontology.org/page) annotation
- Improving [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/) annotations
- Annotating [existing microbial-related tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search2?query=microgalaxy) with EDAM terms
- Reflecting on the addition of EDAM terms to workflows
- Reflecting on missing terms in the EDAM ontology for microbial data analyses
- Brainstorming about a way to connect tool annotations to improve training and workflow annotations

This hackathon is open to other communities than microGalaxy
