# What will you learn?

This course will introduce the Galaxy Platform, covering the basic functionality for single-cell data processing. It will include an overview of various common single-cell datatypes used in bioinformatics. Participants will gain hands-on experience loading single-cell data from external resources into Galaxy, parsing academic literature to find relevant metadata, and converting the data into the common AnnData format, ready for further analysis in Galaxy.


# Who is this for?

- Researchers who want to reuse public single-cell data
- Researchers with little to no programming background who would want to use an interface instead of a programming environment

# Course prerequisites 

Participants are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the Galaxy platform and the available training materials. 

- [A short introduction to Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html)
- [An introduction to scRNA-seq data analysis](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-intro/slides.html#1)
