We will have some community updates followed by a presentation. Mélanie Petera from MetaboHUB Clermont will speak about “Workflow4Experimenters: feedback on a ‘bring your own data’ Galaxy-based training”. Afterwards we also have time for general updates and discussions. If you'd like to discuss particular topics, please add them to the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OrcpWJcHThn8eZd_eURnh1qybp3yetDd_NKtGvdfyjo/edit?usp=sharing) or bring them to the call!
