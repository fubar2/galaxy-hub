The **European Galaxy Days** will be held from the 4th to 6th October 2023 in Freiburg, Germany. This 3-day gathering will be similar to the events we held in [2022](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2022-10-egd/), [2018](https://galaxyproject.org/events/2018-europe-dev/), [2016](https://galaxyproject.org//events/sg2016/), [2014](https://galaxyproject.org//events/sg2014/), and [2012](https://galaxyproject.org//events/switzerland2012/). The first two days will give an overview of the current state of the Galaxy framework with several talks, demonstrations and Birds of a Feather sessions. As part of a CoFest, the third day offer the opportunity to continue the discussions, to code and hack as well as enjoy the Galaxy community.

| Title |  Organizer(s) |  Abstract  |
| ----- |  ------------ |  --------  |
| Small-scale Admins Gathering | Lucille Delisle | Hosting your own Galaxy instance, for a small number of people (or even just yourself)? Welcome to the Galaxy Small Scale Galaxy Admins, a [community of practice](https://galaxyproject.org/community/#communities-of-practice) group. Having grown out of the "Small Scale Servers" subcommittee of the [Global Galaxy Steering Committee](https://galaxyproject.org/community/steering/), our meetings are taking place every two months. This time, we happily meet face to face. Join and share your experiences! |
| microGalaxy Meeting |  Paul Zierep | Many efforts on microbial analysis are done in Galaxy. To avoid redundancy and coordinate our efforts, we started [microGalaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/microbial/#microgalaxy-community), a community focusing on microbial analysis with Galaxy. Whether you are analysing microbiome samples or bacterial isolates, long reads or short, shotgun or 16S, genomics transcriptomics or proteomics, this is the place to be!<br>We organize quarterly community meetings. What’s a better occasion than EGD and a BoF for our next meeting? Anyone interested is welcome to join. |

**Thursday BoFs:**

| [Reducing the environmental impact of Galaxy workflows](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krw121K1vHkxnHKcm4qKQfBNXjagQm_j_6C1mdhjB2Q/edit?usp=sharing) | Nicola Soranzo & José Manuel Domínguez | As with any type of computing, a Galaxy instance consumes energy and has an environmental impact. In this BoF we will look at possible ways to reduce energy consumption and lower carbon emissions of running Galaxy and user workflows. One focus of this BoF will be job scheduling, which distributes user jobs to compute resources in order to optimise utilization while ensuring fairness across users. Most schedulers use "as soon as possible" strategies, however there are users who are flexible enough to wait. Why not take advantage of this to optimise job scheduling also for other criteria? Many data analysis tools have a significant carbon footprint, which could be reduced, for example, by running the jobs when there is a higher share of renewable energy in the grid (time-shifting), or preferring to run jobs in other datacenters powered with greener energy (location-shifting), or both. Concrete approaches to reduce the environmental impact of the computations will be discussed in this BoF, as well as their integration into Galaxy. Let's do it! |
