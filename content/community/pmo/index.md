The **Galaxy Project Management Office (PMO)** is an entity in the [Galaxy governance structures](/community/governance/), distributed across time zones, that aims at supporting the transition towards the new [governance model](/community/governance/) and its future maintenance, ensuring that all the different structures are functioning as described and in an efficient and coordinated way. Furthermore, the PMO takes care of:

* Efficient **project information flows** in and out of governance bodies by
  * Communicating relevant issues raised by other internal and external groups.
  * Communicating relevant activities to the community through news, blog posts and/or in the [Galaxy community calls](/community/community-calls).
* **Open project corporate knowledge** by
  * Standardizing and managing meeting arrangements, documentation of discussion and decisions from all project governance structures ([Executive Board](/community/governance/geb), [GGSC](/community/steering), [Working Groups](/community/wg)).
  * Curating meeting agendas, discussion, recording and action records.
* Building **bridges between internal governance entities** by facilitating communication between different governance and community entities in the project ([Executive Board](/community/governance/geb), [GGSC](/community/steering), [Working Groups](/community/wg)).

The PMO is not aiming at managing grant resources or increasing the bureaucracy within the project.
